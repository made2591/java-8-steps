### Lambda function

##### Lambda definition:

- Define anonymous functions;
- Can be assigned to variables;
- Can be passed to functions;
- Can be returned from functions;

##### They are good for:

- Form the basis of the functional programming paradigm;
- Make parallel programming easier;
- Write more compact code;
- Richer data structure collections;
- Develop cleaner APIs;

__Note__: concept vs. Implementation

A concept can have multiple implementations:

- Map concept is implemented by HashMap, ConcurrentHashMap, etc;
- List concept is implemented by ArrayList, LinkedList, SkipList, etc;

Lambda expressions are a _concept_, that has its own implementation flavor in different languages.
What are lambda? How are implemented in Java?
